# Description:
# If the keyboard shortcut is executed two (2) times it will kill `xeventbind resolution /home/kali/.workspace-preview` since is executed (2) times
# Also kills all the running PIDs which should be 1 (PID) of xeventbind and 1 (PID) of bspwm-workspace-preview
# A while loop is used in the odd case that there are more spawned by other means (aka not using the shortcut)
